# Getting Started

## Requirements

- Android 12.0 or higher
- A Wi-Fi connection

## Installation

First, download the latest APK and install it on your Android device.

You may need to enable installation from unknown sources in your device settings. This setting allows you to install apps from sources other than the Google Play Store.

1. Open the **Settings** app on your device  
2. Look for **Security** or **Privacy** settings (the name may vary depending on your device)  
3. Find the option called **"Install unknown apps"** or **"Install from unknown sources"**

Next, locate and open the APK file you downloaded. Follow the instructions from the installer to complete the installation.

Once the app is installed, a new app with an Android icon and the name ODIM will appear on your device's home page.

## Contributing
ODIM makes it easy for contributors to participate in crowd-sourced data collection. If you are a new contributor, follow these steps to get started:

#### Recording a Trace
1. Navigate to the user dashboard after signing in where existing captures and tasks are listed.  
2. Tap on **New Capture**. It should take you to page where you can select the app you want to record trace for with a description of the trace you will be performing. 
3. Once you have finalized everything Tap on **Start capture**.
4. A QR code corresponding to the new capture will be generated. This contains encoded information linking the task, app, and user.  
5. Open the ODIM Android app and scan this QR code.  
6. Follow on-screen prompts to enable accessibility permissions.

*Note: Some phones may first ask you to grant app permissions. If this happens, go to Settings > Apps > ODIM and enable all necessary permissions.*

#### Perfoming tasks

Launch the target app you want to interact with. ODIM captures your interactions in the background and will save this session (screen and interaction data) as a trace within the app.

After ending a trace, you can:
- View the list of recorded traces within the app interface  
- Select a trace session and upload it directly from your device  

Once uploaded, the trace is immediately available on the same webpage as the QR code. From there, contributors or reviewers can complete the pre-processing workflow, which includes:
- Redacting sensitive information from screenshots  
- Tagging gestures and interactions

#### Stopping ODIM Recording

To stop ODIM from recording entirely:

1. Navigate back to **Settings** > **Accessibility**  
2. Toggle the ODIM app **OFF**

You can restart recording at any time by toggling ODIM back **ON**.

## Post-Process on Mobile App

If you don't want to post-process on the web application, some post-processing actions can be done on the ODIM app before upload.

Specifically, on the app you can:
- Delete extraneous or irrelevant screens from a trace.
- Tag missing or incorrect gestures and interactions
- Redact sensitive information from screens (screenshot and view hierarchy.)

### Deleting Screens

To delete unneeded screens from your trace:

1. Review your trace and locate extraneous screen(s).
2. *Long press* target screen(s) to open up a menu bar on the upper right side.
3. Tap the trash icon (right side) to delete screen(s).

### Tagging Gestures

The ODIM app can be used to both add missing gestures and edit incorrect gestures. The process for both are similar.

#### Tagging Missing Gestures
To add gestures to screens that don't have them:

1. Find screens with missing gestures, they will have a large "**?**" overlay on them.
2. Tap the screens to open gesture tagging interface.
3. Tap on the correct UI element from candidates, which appear as light blue bounding boxes.
4. Tap the "Save" Floating Action Button to confirm the UI element.
5. (If prompted) Select the correct gesture for the screen and confirm choice.

#### Tagging Incorrect Gestures

To edit screens with incorrect gestures:

1. Review your trace and locate the screen with incorrect gesture.
2. Long press the screen to open up a menu bar on the upper right side.
3. Tap the edit icon (left side) to open up edit gesture interface.
4. Tap on the correct UI element from candidates.
5. Tap the "Save" Floating Action Button (FAB) to confirm the UI element.
6. Select the correct gesture for the screen and confirm choice.

### Redacting Screens

Sensitive data can be redacted from both the screenshot and the view hierarchy JSON. The ODIM app provides bounding-box and keyword based redaction methods.

#### Redacting Screens by Bounding Box and Keyword

Screens can be redacted using view hierarchy bounding boxes and keywords:

1. Tap on the screen containing sensitive information to open redaction interface.
2. Tap on the screen bounding box containing that information.
3. Provide a justification for the redaction and (optionally) provide keyword for additional redaction.
4. Tap the FAB to expand redact (pencil icon), erase (cross icon), card view (list icon), and save (save icon).
5. Tap the erase button to remove redactions.
6. Tap the save button to fully redact information from both the screenshot and view hierarchy JSON.

#### Redacting View Hierarchy Metadata

Redaction can be done specifically on view hierarchy metadata through a card view:

1. Tap on the screen containing sensitive information to open redaction interface.
2. Tap the FAB and card view (list icon) button to expand a card view of view hierarchy elements by text and content description.
3. Tap on an item containing sensitive information in the view hierarchy text field or content description.
4. Confirm redaction after tapping the the item card.

*Note: This card view only removes sensitive information that may be hidden inside view hierarchy metadata. Data redacted using the card view will only redact the view hierarchy JSON, not the screenshot itself.*

#### Keyword and card view redaction is currently in development for the post-process web interface.
