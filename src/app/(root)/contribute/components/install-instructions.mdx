# Getting Started

## Requirements

- Android 12.0 or higher
- A Wi-Fi connection

## Installation

First, download the latest APK and install it on your Android device.

You may need to enable installation from unknown sources in your device settings. This setting allows you to install apps from sources other than the Google Play Store.

1. Open the __Settings__ app on your device
1. Look for __Security__ or __Privacy__ settings (the name may vary depending on your device)
1. Find the option  called “Install unknown apps” or “Install from unknown sources”

Next, locate and open the APK file you downloaded. Follow the instructions from the installer to complete the installation.

Once the app is installed, a new app with an Android icon and the name ODIM will appear on your device&rsquo;s home page.

## Capturing Traces

### Preflight

Before capturing a trace, open the ODIM app on your device and enter a worker ID. Any value works for the worker ID, at is obsolete for now.

Next, navigate to the Settings on your device and scroll down to &ldquo;Accessibility&rdquo;. Click on the tab and find the ODIM app. Toggle on and click on &ldquo;allow&rdquo; to start app recording. Some phones may notify you that you need to allow permissions for the app first. To do this, return to the &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; home and navigate to &ldquo;Apps&rdquo;. Find &ldquo;ODIM&rdquo; and give allow permissions.

### Recording

To create a trace, launch the target app and perform a tap on the screen. This will communicate to the ODIM app to begin recording a trace. Keep interacting with the app as normal. ODIM will record your interaction in the background. To end a trace, press the &ldquo;Home&rdquo; button to tell the ODIM that the trace recording is finished. The app will continue recording interactions, but will save the recently recorded collection of screen and interactions as a trace. To stop ODIM from recording your interactions, simply navigate back to &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; &gt; &ldquo;Accessibility&rdquo; &gt; Toggle &ldquo;ODIM&rdquo; off. You can start/stop recording again in the ODIM Accessibility settings by toggling the button &ldquo;on&rdquo;/&ldquo;off&rdquo;.
