# Getting Started

## Requirements

- Android 12.0 or higher
- A Wi-Fi connection

## Installation

First, download the latest APK and install it on your Android device.

You may need to enable installation from unknown sources in your device settings. This setting allows you to install apps from sources other than the Google Play Store.

1. Open the **Settings** app on your device  
2. Look for **Security** or **Privacy** settings (the name may vary depending on your device)  
3. Find the option called **"Install unknown apps"** or **"Install from unknown sources"**

Next, locate and open the APK file you downloaded. Follow the instructions from the installer to complete the installation.

Once the app is installed, a new app with an Android icon and the name ODIM will appear on your device's home page.

## Contributing
ODIM makes it easy for contributors to participate in crowd-sourced data collection. If you are a new contributor, follow these steps to get started:

#### Recording a Trace
1. Navigate to the user dashboard after signing in where existing captures and tasks are listed.  
2. Click on **New Capture**. It should take you to page where you can select the app you want to record trace for with a description of the trace you will be performing. 
3. Once you have finalized everything click on **Start capture**.
4. A QR code corresponding to the new capture will be generated. This contains encoded information linking the task, app, and user.  
5. Open the ODIM Android app and scan this QR code.  
6. Follow on-screen prompts to enable accessibility permissions.

*Note: Some phones may first ask you to grant app permissions. If this happens, go to Settings > Apps > ODIM and enable all necessary permissions.*

#### Perfoming tasks

Launch the target app you want to interact with. ODIM captures your interactions in the background and will save this session (screen and interaction data) as a trace within the app.

After ending a trace, you can:
- View the list of recorded traces within the app interface  
- Select a trace session and upload it directly from your device  

Once uploaded, the trace is immediately available on the same webpage as the QR code. From there, contributors or reviewers can complete the pre-processing workflow, which includes:
- Redacting sensitive information from screenshots  
- Tagging gestures and interactions

#### Stopping ODIM Recording

To stop ODIM from recording entirely:

1. Navigate back to **Settings** > **Accessibility**  
2. Toggle the ODIM app **OFF**

You can restart recording at any time by toggling ODIM back **ON**.
