Welcome to **InteractionMining.org**, a research platform for interaction data collection and analysis. By uploading or using our services, you agree to the following terms:

## 1. Data Storage and Redaction

- All uploaded traces, including raw screenshots, view hierarchies, and interaction metadata, will be **stored indefinitely** for research, audit, and legal purposes.
- Only **redacted data** will be made available through the public repository or shared with third parties.

## 2. User Responsibility for Data Privacy

- **You are solely responsible** for redacting personally identifiable information (PII) or any other sensitive data before publishing traces to the platform.
- ODIM provides redaction tools within both the mobile and web interfaces, and we **strongly recommend** using them prior to publishing.
- If you identify sensitive data in your trace that cannot be redacted using available tools but is **extractable or visible**, you must contact the research team immediately at [contact@interactionmining.org](mailto:contact@interactionmining.org) for assistance.

## 3. Privacy Awareness

- Do not upload traces containing data from third-party users without their consent.
- Avoid capturing sessions that expose private information such as passwords, addresses, financial details, or messages unless you are prepared to fully redact them.
- Uploaded traces may be periodically reviewed and moderated for compliance, but we **do not guarantee** full screening or protection if redaction is incomplete.

## 4. Research Use

- This service is intended for academic and research purposes only. All data may be used for future studies, publications, and ML dataset curation, in accordance with our ethics review.
