#### Redacting View Hierarchy Metadata

Redaction can be done specifically on view hierarchy metadata through a card view:

1. Tap on the screen containing sensitive information to open redaction interface.
2. Tap the FAB and card view (list icon) button to expand a card view of view hierarchy elements by text and content description.
3. Tap on an item containing sensitive information in the view hierarchy text field or content description.
4. Confirm redaction after tapping the the item card.

*Note: This card view only removes sensitive information that may be hidden inside view hierarchy metadata. Data redacted using the card view will only redact the view hierarchy JSON, not the screenshot itself.*

#### Keyword and card view redaction is currently in development for the post-process web interface.
