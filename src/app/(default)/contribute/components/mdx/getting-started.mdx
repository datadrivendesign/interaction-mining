# Getting Started

Welcome to Interaction Mining: a privacy-preserving, open-source project to collect organic mobile app task flows. 

We enable collection of app task flows directly from your Android phone. We do this using an Android app through [Accessibility Service API](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/accessibilityservice/AccessibilityService) and our web application. 

**Check out our code below:**

<div className="flex flex-col md:flex-row w-full justify-evenly">
    <Button className="w-min" disabled>
        <ArrowUpRight size={20} className="mr-1" />
        Web Application Source
    </Button>

    <Button className="w-min" disabled>
        <ArrowUpRight size={20} className="mr-1" />
        Android Application Source
    </Button>
</div>


*We plan on supporting iOS app task flow collection in the near future.*
