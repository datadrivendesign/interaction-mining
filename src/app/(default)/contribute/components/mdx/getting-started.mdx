# Getting Started

Welcome to Interaction Mining: a privacy-preserving, open-source project to collect organic mobile app task flows. 

We enable collection of app task flows directly from your Android phone. We do this using an Android app through [Accessibility Service API](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/accessibilityservice/AccessibilityService) and our web application. 

Our web application is written in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), a React framework.

**Check out our code below:**

<div className="flex flex-col md:flex-row w-full justify-evenly">
    <Link
        href="https://github.com/datadrivendesign/interaction-mining"
        target="_blank"
    >
        <Button className="w-min">
            <ArrowUpRight size={20} className="mr-1" />
            Web App Source
        </Button>
    </Link>


    <Link
        href="https://github.com/datadrivendesign/odim-android"
        target="_blank"
    >
        <Button className="w-min">
            <ArrowUpRight size={20} className="mr-1" />
            Android App Source
        </Button>
    </Link>
</div>


*We plan on supporting iOS app task flow collection in the near future.*
