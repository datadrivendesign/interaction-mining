## Contributing
ODIM makes it easy for contributors to participate in crowd-sourced data collection. If you are a new contributor, follow these steps to get started:

#### Creating a Trace
1. Navigate to the web user dashboard after signing in where existing captures and tasks are listed.  
2. Tap on **New Capture**. It should take you to page where you can select the app you want to record trace for with a description of the trace you will be performing. 
    - You can add a new app by providing the Android app package name on Google Play Store or iOS app bundle ID on the App Store.
    - You can find the package name of an app from its [Google Play Store URL](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/9972781)
    - You can find the iOS bundle ID of an app from the [App Store URL](https://www.nutrient.io/guides/ios/faq/finding-the-app-bundle-id/)
3. Once you have finalized everything Tap on **Start capture**.
4. A QR code corresponding to the new capture will be generated. This contains encoded information linking the task, app, and user.  
5. Open the ODIM Android app and scan this QR code.  
6. Follow on-screen prompts to enable accessibility permissions.

*Note: Some phones may first ask you to grant app permissions. If this happens, go to Settings > Apps > ODIM and enable all necessary permissions.*
