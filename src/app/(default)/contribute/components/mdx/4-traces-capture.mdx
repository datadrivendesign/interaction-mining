#### Capturing a Trace

Launch the target app you want to interact with. ODIM captures your interactions in the background and will save this session (screen and interaction data) as a trace within the app.

After ending a trace, you can:
- View the list of recorded traces within the app interface  
- Select a trace session and upload it directly from your device  

Once uploaded, the trace is immediately available on the same webpage as the QR code. From there, contributors or reviewers can complete the pre-processing workflow, which includes:
- Redacting sensitive information from screenshots  
- Tagging gestures and interactions

#### Stopping ODIM Recording

To stop ODIM from recording entirely:

1. Navigate back to **Settings** > **Accessibility**  
2. Toggle the ODIM app **OFF**

You can restart recording at any time by toggling ODIM back **ON**.
