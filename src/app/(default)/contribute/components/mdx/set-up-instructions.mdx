## Set Up a Local Interaction Mining Instance

This is a set up and explanation guide for running our interaction mining installation bash script.

### Running the Setup Script

Run the following command to download and run our script:

```bash
curl -o- https://dribosc0et3qr.cloudfront.net/install.sh | bash;
```

The script will step you through the setup and build for both the web and mobile app.

‚ùó Our script uses [`homebrew`](https://brew.sh) to install dependencies. Make sure you have it installed first before running our script. 

The script targets for OSX devices, but may work on Linux with `homebrew` installed.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Interaction Mining Web App Dependencies

The script first checks if web app dependencies are installed before setting up.

#### Node.js (Web App)

Our web app uses¬†**Next.js**, which requires Node.js (v16 or v18). The script checks if you have `node` and `npm` installed. It will install them for you if you don't have them.

#### MinIO

[MinIO](https://github.com/minio/) is an open-source, S3-compatible object store that can be run locally using Docker. We use it as a replacement for S3 in the local environment.

The script installs MinIO through Docker. If you do not have Docker installed, the script will install Docker for you through `homebrew`.

‚ö†Ô∏è **If Docker was downloaded for the first time, you need to manually start Docker to complete set up.**

The script will prompt you for various settings to create a Docker compose file (`docker-compose.yml`) to set up MinIO:

1. Provide **username** and **password** credentials to set up MinIO object store access.
2. Provide a **bucket name** to store uploaded task flow data.


The script will use [MinIO Client CLI](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/reference/minio-mc.html) to automatically create the bucket and set public permissions for you. If you do not have the CLI installed, the script will install it.

#### MongoDB

This script uses MongoDB (Community Edition) to spin up a local Mongo server.

The script checks if MongoDB is installed by checking for a Mongo Shell (`mongosh`) installation. If you do not have `mongosh` installed, it will install MongoDB for you.

The script will prompt you for some settings to set up Mongo:

1. Provide a **directory name** for where you want Mongo database data to be stored.
2. Provide **database name** for where interaction mining data will be uploaded to.

The script will create a Mongo configuration file (`mongo.conf`). Then it will use the file initialize the database. with a replication set (required).

#### Auth.js + Google OAuth

‚ùó **You will need to manually set up Google Authentication**.

We use¬†[Auth.js](https://authjs.dev/)¬†with Google OAuth to handle authentication. To enable Google Authentication, you need to set up a Google OAuth app:

1. Go to¬†[Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Create a new project.
3. Go to¬†`APIs & Services`¬†‚Üí¬†`OAuth consent screen` and fill out the form.
    - Set user type to¬†**External**
    - Add scopes:¬†`email`,¬†`profile`,¬†`openid`
4. Go to¬†`Credentials`¬†‚Üí¬†`Create Credentials`¬†‚Üí¬†`OAuth client ID`
    - Application type:¬†**Web Application**
    - Redirect URI:¬†`http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`¬†(or your deployed domain)
5. Save your¬†**Client ID**¬†and¬†**Client Secret**. **The script will need it later.**

### Cloning The Interaction Mining Web Repository

The script will clone the interaction mining [web app code repository]() and install package dependencies with the command:
```bash
npm install
```

### ODIM Web Env Variables

The script will set most of the env variables based on previous inputs you made.

These environment variables will be saved to `.env.local`, you can always manually modify them later on.

**The script will prompt you to manually enter OAuth Google Client ID and Secret:** `AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`.

Here are the expected env variables you should see in `.env.local`:
```env
DATABASE_URL=
_AWS_REGION=
_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
_AWS_UPLOAD_BUCKET=
NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_CLOUDFRONT_URL=
USE_MINIO_STORE=
MINIO_ENDPOINT=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEPLOYMENT_URL=
```

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Interaction Mining Mobile App (Android)

Next, the script will ask whether you want to set up the ODIM Android mobile app. If not, you can skip this section.

#### Java Set Up

Our Android app requires **Java JDK 17 or higher** to build. The script will install `OpenJDK v17` and add it to your `$PATH` variable if you do not have it.

#### Android Studio SDK Set Up

The Android SDK is necessary to build the Android app. **The minimum required SDK version is v34**. 

If the SDK is not already installed, the script uses `homebrew` to install `android-commandlinetools`, which is used to install Android build tools and SDK. 

The script will attempt to install the SDK through the command line. You will need to agree to license agreements and wait for the install to finish.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Run `source` on your terminal profile after the script is finished to make sure your system can find Java and Android SDK outside the script.**

```bash
# After script finishes, run:
source ~/.zprofile  # if using zsh
source ~/.bash_profile  # if using bash
```

#### Clone the Mobile App Repository

The script will clone the [mobile app code repository](). Then it will write your installed SDK path to `local.properties` so the build tool knows where the SDK is located.

#### Build Mobile App APK

The script will try to bundle an **APK** using a Gradle script in the mobile repo. The script requires parameter `API_URL_PREFIX`: the root url domain of the web app. 

The app will use this parameter to upload recorded task flows. This parameter is automatically set by the script as the **local IP address of the web server**. 

The APK build command:
```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug -PAPI_URL_PREFIX="$API_URL_PREFIX"
```

Once the build is done, the path to where the APK is bundled is printed. You can install this file on an Android phone or add it to an emulator.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Only use `./gradlew assembleDebug` for local development. Debug builds allow cleartext (HTTP) traffic, which pose a security risk in production.** 

**Use `./gradlew assembleRelease` for production APK builds, which block insecure HTTP calls by default.**

### Running ODIM on Localhost

Finally, the script starts the web development server: 
```bash
npm run dev -- -H 0.0.0.0
```
The parameters `-- -H 0.0.0.0` binds the development server to all IPs, allowing other devices on your network to access your local server.

### Cleaning Up Local Dependencies

Shut down local Docker containers:
```bash
docker compose down
```

Remove the MinIO bucket: delete the `minio_data` directory specified in `docker-compose.yml`.

Remove mongo data: delete the mongo directory specified in `mongo.conf`.
