## Set Up a Local Interaction Mining Instance

This is a guide for running our interaction mining installation script. We also explain what the script does below.

### Running the Setup Script

Run the following command to download and run our script:

```bash
curl -o- https://dribosc0et3qr.cloudfront.net/install.sh | bash;
```

The script will step you through the setup and build for both the web and mobile app.

‚ùó Our script uses [`homebrew`](https://brew.sh) to install dependencies. Make sure you have it installed first before running our script. The script is currently targeted for OSX devices, but it may work on Linux with `homebrew` installed.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Interaction Mining Web App Dependencies

The script first checks if web app dependencies are installed. If not, then it will install them for you.

#### Node.js (Web App)

Our web interface uses¬†**Next.js**, which requires Node.js (v16 or v18). The script checks if you have `node` and `npm` installed. If these programs are not detected, it will install these packages for you.

#### MinIO Set Up

[MinIO](https://github.com/minio/) is an open-source, S3-compatible object store that can be run locally using Docker. We use it as a replacement for S3 in the local environment.

The script installs MinIO through Docker. If you do not have Docker installed, the script will install Docker for you through `homebrew`.

‚ö†Ô∏è **If Docker was downloaded for the first time, you need to manually start Docker to complete set up.**

The script will prompt you for **username** and **password** credentials to set up the MinIO object store. These credentials will be needed to access the object store bucket. The script then creates a Docker compose file to set up MinIO with these credentials. Docker will create a container with MinIO installed using the settings in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

The script then asks you to provide a **bucket name** and creates the bucket to store your trace data. The script will use [MinIO Client CLI](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/reference/minio-mc.html) to create the bucket. If you do not have the CLI installed, the script will install it for you. The script will use this CLI to automate bucket creation and set permissions to make bucket objects publicly available.

#### MongoDB Community Edition Set Up

MongoDB Community Edition is a version of MongoDB that allows users to locally set up a Mongo server on their own machines. The script uses this to set up a Mongo server for the local ODIM instance.

The script will first check if MongoDB Community Edition is installed on your device. Specifically it checks if you have Mongo Shell (`mongosh`) installed. If you do not have MongoDB installed on your device, it will use install it for you.

The script will proceed to create a Mongo database to store ODIM trace metadata. You will be prompted to give a directory **name** for where database data will be stored. Next the script will create a configuration file (`mongo.conf`). 

The script then starts up the MongoDB process and sets up the database with the config file. The database is initialized with a replication set (required for our web app). Finally, the script will prompt you for a Mongo database **name** and create the database for you.

#### Auth.js with Google OAuth

‚ùó If you are setting up a local ODIM instance, **you will need to manually set up Google Authentication**.

We use¬†[Auth.js](https://authjs.dev/)¬†with Google OAuth to handle authentication. To enable Google Authentication:

1. Set up a Google OAuth app:
    - Go to¬†[Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
    - Create a new project.
    - Go to¬†`APIs & Services`¬†‚Üí¬†`OAuth consent screen`:
        - Set user type to¬†**External**
        - Add scopes:¬†`email`,¬†`profile`,¬†`openid`
    - Go to¬†`Credentials`¬†‚Üí¬†`Create Credentials`¬†‚Üí¬†`OAuth client ID`
        - Application type:¬†**Web Application**
        - Redirect URI:¬†`http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`¬†(or your deployed domain)
2. Save your¬†**Client ID**¬†and¬†**Client Secret**.

The script will ask you for your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** for the ODIM web set up later.

### Cloning The ODIM Web Repository

You will be prompted to choose cloning by HTTP or SSH. The script will then clone the ODIM Web repository: [https://github.com/datadrivendesign/odim-frontend-next.git]()

Once the repo is cloned, the script will install the package dependencies of the repo using
```bash
npm install
```

### ODIM Web Env Variables

The script will set most of the environment variables for you based on previous inputs you made. For a local instance of ODIM, the URLs will be the device's IP address and the AWS settings will for MinIO. 

These environment variables will be saved to `.env.local`, you can always manually modify them later on. The script will also automatically generate and add the `AUTH_SECRET` env variable to `.env.local`. This variable is required by the Auth.js library.

**The script will prompt you to manually enter Auth Google variables:** `AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`. These should have been set up in [NextAuth with Google OAuth](#nextauth-with-google-oauth).

```env
DATABASE_URL=
_AWS_REGION=
_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
_AWS_UPLOAD_BUCKET=
USE_MINIO_STORE=
MINIO_ENDPOINT=
AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEPLOYMENT_URL=
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è ODIM Mobile (Android) Set Up

Next, the script will ask whether you want to set up the ODIM Android mobile app. If not, the script will [skip the set up in this section](#running-odim-on-localhost). 

#### Java Set Up

Our Android app requires **Java JDK 17 or higher** to build. The script will check if Java is installed and if you have the correct version. If not, it will install `OpenJDK v17` and add it to your `$PATH` variable. 

#### Android Studio SDK Set Up

The script will next set up the Android SDK, which is necessary to build the Android app. The script first checks if your device has an Android SDK installed or not. **The minimum required SDK version is v34**. 

If the SDK is not installed, the script uses `homebrew` to install `android-commandlinetools`. The script uses this command line tool to install the proper Android build tools and Android SDK. 

The script will attempt to install the SDK through the command line. You will need to agree to license agreements and wait for the install to finish.

‚ö†Ô∏è **To make sure your system can find Java and Android SDK outside the script**, make sure to run `source` on your terminal profile after the script is finished.

```bash
# After script finishes, run:
source ~/.zprofile  # if using zsh
source ~/.bash_profile  # if using bash
```

#### Cloning the ODIM Mobile Repository

You will again choose to clone by HTTP or SSH. The script will then clone from:
[https://github.com/datadrivendesign/mobile-odim.git](). After the repo is cloned, the script will write your installed SDK path to `local.properties` so your project knows where the SDK is located.

#### Build the Mobile ODIM APK

Once Mobile ODIM repository is cloned, the script will try to bundle an APK (app package). The APK build script takes one command line parameter, `API_URL_PREFIX`, which is the root url domain of where the ODIM web app is hosted. This is where the app will upload trace data to. **This parameter is automatically set by the script** as the local IP address of the web server (or where the dev environment is deployed). 

The APK is built using a Gradle script in the mobile repo: 
```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug -PAPI_URL_PREFIX="$API_URL_PREFIX"
```

Once the build is done, the script will print the path to where the APK was built. You can install this file on an Android phone or add it to an emulator to run the app.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Note**: Use `./gradlew assembleDebug` only for local development. Debug builds allow cleartext (HTTP) traffic, which poses a security risk in production. Using `./gradlew assembleRelease` for production APKs, will block insecure HTTP calls by default.

---

### Running ODIM on Localhost

Finally, the script starts the web development server: 
```bash
npm run dev -- -H 0.0.0.0
```
The parameters `-- -H 0.0.0.0` makes the site accessible from external devices on your network. Specifically, it binds the development server to all IPs, allowing other devices on your network to access your local server.

### Cleaning Up Local Dependencies

These are instructions on how to remove local dependencies.
- To shut down local Docker containers:
    ```bash
    docker compose down
    ```
- To remove storage bucket, delete the `minio_data` specified in the docker compose file.
- To remove mongo data, delete the mongo directory specified in `mongo.conf`.
