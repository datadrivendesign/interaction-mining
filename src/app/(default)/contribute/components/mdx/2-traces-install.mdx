## Android app Installation

Download the latest APK and install it on your Android device.

You may need to enable installation from unknown sources in your device settings. This setting allows you to install apps from sources other than the Google Play Store.

1. Open the **Settings** app on your device  
2. Look for **Security** or **Privacy** settings (the name may vary depending on your device)  
3. Find the option called **"Install unknown apps"** or **"Install from unknown sources"**

Next, locate and open the APK file you downloaded. Follow the instructions from the installer to complete the installation.

Once the app is installed, a new app with an Android icon and the name ODIM will appear on your device's home page.
