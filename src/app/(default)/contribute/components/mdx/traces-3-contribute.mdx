import { Plus } from "lucide-react";


### Create a New Task Flow

1. Sign in to the web application and navigate to the user dashboard.  
2. Click on <Button size={"sm"}><Plus /> New</Button> to redirect to new task creation form.
3. Fill out the form with chosen app and description and click <Button className="dark:bg-neutral-50 dark:text-black" type="submit">Start Capture</Button> 
    - Add a new app by providing the Android app's package name from its [Google Play Store URL](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/9972781)
4. A QR code corresponding to the new capture will be generated.  
5. Open the Android app and scan this QR code to get task information.
6. Follow on-screen prompts to enable accessibility permissions.

*Note: Some phones may first ask you to grant app permissions. If this happens, go to Settings > Apps > ODIM and enable all necessary permissions.*
