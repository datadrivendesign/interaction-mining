## Post-Process on Mobile App

If you don't want to post-process on the web application, some post-processing actions can be done on the ODIM app before upload.

Specifically, on the app you can:
- Delete extraneous or irrelevant screens from a trace.
- Tag missing or incorrect gestures and interactions
- Redact sensitive information from screens (screenshot and view hierarchy.)

### Deleting Screens

To delete unneeded screens from your trace:

1. Review your trace and locate extraneous screen(s).
2. *Long press* target screen(s) to open up a menu bar on the upper right side.
3. Tap the trash icon (right side) to delete screen(s).
