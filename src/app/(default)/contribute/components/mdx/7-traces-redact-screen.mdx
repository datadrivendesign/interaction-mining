### Redacting Screens

Sensitive data can be redacted from both the screenshot and the view hierarchy JSON. The ODIM app provides bounding-box and keyword based redaction methods.

#### Redacting Screens by Bounding Box and Keyword

Screens can be redacted using view hierarchy bounding boxes and keywords:

1. Tap on the screen containing sensitive information to open redaction interface.
2. Tap on the screen bounding box containing that information.
3. Provide a justification for the redaction and (optionally) provide keyword for additional redaction.
4. Tap the FAB to expand redact (pencil icon), erase (cross icon), card view (list icon), and save (save icon).
5. Tap the erase button to remove redactions.
6. Tap the save button to fully redact information from both the screenshot and view hierarchy JSON.
