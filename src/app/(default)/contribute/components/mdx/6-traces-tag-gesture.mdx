### Tagging Gestures

The ODIM app can be used to both add missing gestures and edit incorrect gestures. The process for both are similar.

#### Tagging Missing Gestures
To add gestures to screens that don't have them:

1. Find screens with missing gestures, they will have a large "**?**" overlay on them.
2. Tap the screens to open gesture tagging interface.
3. Tap on the correct UI element from candidates, which appear as light blue bounding boxes.
4. Tap the "Save" Floating Action Button to confirm the UI element.
5. (If prompted) Select the correct gesture for the screen and confirm choice.

#### Tagging Incorrect Gestures

To edit screens with incorrect gestures:

1. Review your trace and locate the screen with incorrect gesture.
2. Long press the screen to open up a menu bar on the upper right side.
3. Tap the edit icon (left side) to open up edit gesture interface.
4. Tap on the correct UI element from candidates.
5. Tap the "Save" Floating Action Button (FAB) to confirm the UI element.
6. Select the correct gesture for the screen and confirm choice.
