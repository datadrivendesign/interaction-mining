### Capture a Task From Mobile App

Launch the target app you want to interact with. The interaction mining app captures your screens and interactions in the background.

After ending a trace, you can:
- View the list of screens of the task flow from the app interface  
- Select the recorded task flow and upload it from your device  

Once uploaded, the screens should be detected by the web app. From there, you can complete the pre-processing workflow, which includes:
- Tagging gestures and interactions
- Redacting sensitive information from screenshots  

#### Stopping ODIM Recording

To stop ODIM from recording entirely:

1. Navigate back to **Settings** > **Accessibility**  
2. Toggle the ODIM app **OFF**

You can restart recording at any time by toggling ODIM back **ON**.
